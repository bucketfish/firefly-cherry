## contribute
to contribute, you'll need to add [PKBeam's fork of SwordRPC](https://github.com/PKBeam/SwordRPC) as a package. for some reason i couldn't import it directly and had to add it manually.

you'll also want to add your own discord bot id, if you're making it something new :)

no builds for this yet so you can't install it oops.
