## installing
install it by downloading the firefly-cherry.app.zip on the right, under releases 🥳

‼️ getting a security issue? ‼️
- right click the app -> open -> allow it to run, OR open system preferences -> privacy & security -> scroll down and allow it to run
- \[technical stuff] why security issue? this app needs to disable sandboxed mode in order to 1. connect locally to your discord for rich presence, and 2. run applescripts to manage your spotify :)

## updating
you can update by following the download instructions & just replace the old version!


## contribute
to contribute, you'll need to add [PKBeam's fork of SwordRPC](https://github.com/PKBeam/SwordRPC) as a package. for some reason i couldn't import it directly and had to add it manually.

you'll also want to add your own discord bot id, if you're making it something new :)
